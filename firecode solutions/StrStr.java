/*
Implement strstr(). Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or â€“1
if needle is not part of haystack.

There are known efficient algorithms for this like Boyer-Moore, but since they are advanced algorithms, 
They are not good for attempting to solve in interviews.  A direct brute force is sufficient for interviews.

Assume n= length of haystack and m = length of needle
