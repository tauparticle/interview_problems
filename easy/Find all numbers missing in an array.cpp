 Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
 
 Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
 
 Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
 
 Example:
 
 Input:
 [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 
 Output:
 [5,6]

     The idea is simple, if nums[i] != i + 1 and nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1], then we swap nums[i] with nums[nums[i] - 1], for example, nums[0] = 4 and nums[3] = 7, then we swap nums[0] with nums[3]. So In the end the array will be sorted and if nums[i] != i + 1, then i + 1 is missing.
     The example run as follows
     
     [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
     [7,3,2,4,8,2,3,1]
     [3,3,2,4,8,2,7,1]
     [2,3,3,4,8,2,7,1]
     [3,2,3,4,8,2,7,1]
     [3,2,3,4,1,2,7,8]
     [1,2,3,4,3,2,7,8]
     Since every swap we put at least one number to its correct position, the time is O(n)
